# node-git-tools

Tools for parsing data out of git repositories.

## About

The goal of node-git-tools is to provide a set of tools that can be used to
easily write custom git commands or other scripts that are tightly integrated
with git.

I expect the API to grow over time and will happily entertain any feature
requests. If there is anything you'd like added, just file an issue.

## Installation

```sh
npm install git-tools
```

## Usage

```js
var Repo = require( "git-tools" );
var repo = new Repo( "path/to/repo" );
repo.authors(function( error, authors ) {
	console.log( authors );
});
```
